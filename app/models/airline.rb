# Defines a model for airlines.
#
# Airlines can be used in multiple ways in this application:
# 
# * *Administrating* *airline*: The entity responsible for administrating a
#   {Flight}. This is generally the airline who provides the livery for the
#   plane, the branding at the gate, the airline name on the airport flight
#   status screens, flight planning, and so on.
# * *Operator*: The entity which actually operates a {Flight}. Sometimes this
#   will be the same as the administrating airline, and sometimes the
#   administrating airline will contract this flight to another airline which
#   operates the flight under the administrating airline's branding.
# * *Codeshare*: An Airline which sold a ticket on second airline's {Flight}.
#   Often used when the airline the ticket is purchased from doesn't serve one
#   or more of the airports on the itinerary. The second airline may
#   potentially also be the operator of the flight, or they may further
#   contract it to a third operator airline which flies under the second
#   airlineâ€™s branding.
#
# Thus, the {Flight} model has Airline ID columns for each of the above types.
# The (administrating) airline ID is required, and the operator and codeshare
# airline IDs are optional.
