# Defines a model for aircraft families.
#
# For the purposes of this application, an AircraftFamily object can either be
# a parent *family* (e.g. Boeing 737), or a child *type* (e.g. Boeing 737-800).
# A family can have zero to many types, but each type must have exactly one
# family. The relationship is defined by a parent_id column, which is nil for
# parent families, but set for child types.
#
# Generally, a {Flight} would refer to an AircraftFamily type for its
# aircraft_family_id; however, if the specific type is not known, it can
# refer to an AircraftFamily family.
#
# Aircraft types are defined by ICAO codes; if two aircraft variants have the
# same ICAO type designator, then they are considered the same aircraft type
# within this application. Aircraft families are defined by the most generic
# IATA type code available â€“ preferably an IATA code covering an entire family
# of aircraft, but if not, the IATA code for the most common variant of that
# family should be used.
