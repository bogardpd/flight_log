<h1>Aircraft Families</h1>

<p>This listing shows how often I've flown on each particular type (family) of airplane. Each type of airplane may have several variants, but all of those variants have been included in each family's total.</p>

<p>I have flown on <%= pluralize(@aircraft_array.count, 'aircraft family') %>.</p>
