  # Takes a {http://www.gcmap.com/ Great Circle Mapper} map
  # image and serves it from the Flight Historian server. This is needed
  # because the Great Circle Mapper is HTTP only while Flight Historian is
  # HTTPS, and browsers will give certificate errors if an HTTP image is
  # embedded in an HTTPS page.
  # 
  # In order to prevent other sites from using this proxy, this method will
  # only render an image if the parameters include a valid checksum generated
  # by {Map.hash_image_query}, and will otherwise return a Not Found error.
  #
  # Many maps will have forward slashes ("/") in the Great Circle Mapper query,
  # which gets escaped to %2F. However, this means the query will take up more
  # characters, which could be a problem with some browsers' character length
  # limit with very long queries. Thus, the proxy will accept queries with
  # underscores ("_"), which do not get escaped, in place of slashes, and will
  # convert them as appropriate. Escaped slashes will also work.
