      # Declare a block of code to be run before each example (using `:each`)
      # or once before any example (using `:all`). These are usually declared
      # directly in the [ExampleGroup](ExampleGroup) to which they apply, but
      # they can also be shared across multiple groups.
      #
      # You can also use `before(:suite)` to run a block of code before any
      # example groups are run. This should be declared in
      # [RSpec.configure](../../RSpec#configure-class_method)
      #
      # Instance variables declared in `before(:each)` or `before(:all)` are
      # accessible within each example.
      #
      # ### Order
      #
      # `before` hooks are stored in three scopes, which are run in order:
      # `:suite`, `:all`, and `:each`. They can also be declared in several
      # different places: `RSpec.configure`, a parent group, the current group.
      # They are run in the following order:
      #
      #     before(:suite) # declared in RSpec.configure
      #     before(:all)   # declared in RSpec.configure
      #     before(:all)   # declared in a parent group
      #     before(:all)   # declared in the current group
      #     before(:each)  # declared in RSpec.configure
      #     before(:each)  # declared in a parent group
      #     before(:each)  # declared in the current group
      #
      # If more than one `before` is declared within any one scope, they are run
      # in the order in which they are declared.
      #
      # ### Conditions
      #
      # When you add a conditions hash to `before(:each)` or `before(:all)`,
      # RSpec will only apply that hook to groups or examples that match the
      # conditions. e.g.
      #
      #     RSpec.configure do |config|
      #       config.before(:each, :authorized => true) do
      #         log_in_as :authorized_user
      #       end
      #     end
      #
      #     describe Something, :authorized => true do
      #       # the before hook will run in before each example in this group
      #     end
      #
      #     describe SomethingElse do
      #       it "does something", :authorized => true do
      #         # the before hook will run before this example
      #       end
      #
      #       it "does something else" do
      #         # the hook will not run before this example
      #       end
      #     end
      #
      # ### Warning: `before(:suite, :with => :conditions)`
      #
      # The conditions hash is used to match against specific examples. Since
      # `before(:suite)` is not run in relation to any specific example or
      # group, conditions passed along with `:suite` are effectively ignored.
      #
      # ### Exceptions
      #
      # When an exception is raised in a `before` block, RSpec skips any
      # subsequent `before` blocks and the example, but runs all of the
      # `after(:each)` and `after(:all)` hooks.
      #
      # ### Warning: implicit before blocks
      #
      # `before` hooks can also be declared in shared contexts which get
      # included implicitly either by you or by extension libraries. Since
      # RSpec runs these in the order in which they are declared within each
      # scope, load order matters, and can lead to confusing results when one
      # before block depends on state that is prepared in another before block
      # that gets run later.
      #
      # ### Warning: `before(:all)`
      #
      # It is very tempting to use `before(:all)` to speed things up, but we
      # recommend that you avoid this as there are a number of gotchas, as well
      # as things that simply don't work.
      #
      # #### context
      #
      # `before(:all)` is run in an example that is generated to provide group
      # context for the block.
      #
      # #### instance variables
      #
      # Instance variables declared in `before(:all)` are shared across all the
      # examples in the group.  This means that each example can change the
      # state of a shared object, resulting in an ordering dependency that can
      # make it difficult to reason about failures.
      #
      # ### other frameworks
      #
      # Mock object frameworks and database transaction managers (like
      # ActiveRecord) are typically designed around the idea of setting up
      # before an example, running that one example, and then tearing down.
      # This means that mocks and stubs can (sometimes) be declared in
      # `before(:all)`, but get torn down before the first real example is ever
      # run.
      #
      # You _can_ create database-backed model objects in a `before(:all)` in
      # rspec-rails, but it will not be wrapped in a transaction for you, so
      # you are on your own to clean up in an `after(:all)` block.
      #
      # @example before(:each) declared in an [ExampleGroup](ExampleGroup)
      #
      #     describe Thing do
      #       before(:each) do
      #         @thing = Thing.new
      #       end
      #
      #       it "does something" do
      #         # here you can access @thing
      #       end
      #     end
      #
      # @example before(:all) declared in an [ExampleGroup](ExampleGroup)
      #
      #     describe Parser do
      #       before(:all) do
      #         File.open(file_to_parse, 'w') do |f|
      #           f.write <<-CONTENT
      #             stuff in the file
      #           CONTENT
      #         end
      #       end
      #
      #       it "parses the file" do
      #         Parser.parse(file_to_parse)
      #       end
      #
      #       after(:all) do
      #         File.delete(file_to_parse)
      #       end

      #
      # ### Exceptions
      #
      # `after` hooks are guaranteed to run even when there are exceptions in
      # `before` hooks or examples.  When an exception is raised in an after
      # block, the exception is captured for later reporting, and subsequent
      # `after` blocks are run.
      #
      # ### Order
      #
      # `after` hooks are stored in three scopes, which are run in order:
      # `:each`, `:all`, and `:suite`. They can also be declared in several
      # different places: `RSpec.configure`, a parent group, the current group.
      # They are run in the following order:
      #

      #     after(:all)  # declared in a parent group
      #     after(:all)  # declared in RSpec.configure
      #
      # This is the reverse of the order in which `before` hooks are run.

      # they are run in reverse order of that in which they are declared.

      #
      # @note the syntax of `around` is similar to that of `before` and `after`
      #   but the semantics are quite different. `before` and `after` hooks are
      #   run in the context of of the examples with which they are associated,
      #   whereas `around` hooks are actually responsible for running the
      #   examples. Consequently, `around` hooks do not have direct access to
      #   resources that are made available within the examples and their
      #   associated `before` and `after` hooks.
      #
      # @note `:each` is the only supported scope.

      # like a `Proc`.  This is especially handy when working with libaries
      # that manage their own setup and teardown using a block or proc syntax,
      # e.g.
      #
